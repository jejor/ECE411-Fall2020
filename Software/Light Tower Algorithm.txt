Set standby (no signal received) state on LEDs (or everything good state if we don’t use a standby state)
While waiting for signal, check power to make sure that we have not switched to battery (power loss)
If power loss, switch to power loss state
Assert LEDs
Keep checking for power to be restored
If power gets restored, go back to waiting for signal


Wait for signal from AI (state change)
(If we can get an interrupt signal from the source, that would be ideal so that we don’t miss a state change.  Otherwise, we just need a quick, busy poll to see when the state changes.)


        If interrupt:
Check interrupt to make sure it came from the state change
If not our interrupt, go back to waiting
else...
Turn off interrupts
Read what state we are changing to
Save changed state to current state variable
Enable interrupts again and go to changed state function
        If polling:
Keep checking line to see if state changes
When state changes, check to see if state is valid (what we got is actually a state change)
If state is not valid (state did not change or other signal was seen)
else...
Save changed state to current state variable
Go to state changed function


When state changes…
Sleep for time it takes for valves to change (1 sec?)
Get state of each valve
Save individual value states to value state variables
Combine individual states to be one variable for quicker checking (store in hex with each bit being open/closed to make unique hex codes to quickly check)


Compare actual state hex to expected state hex
        If state matches:
Set current state to be everything good
Assert LEDs for state
Go back to waiting
        If state does not match: 
(optional check: check previous state to see if machine did not change states)
Check valves one by one (high priority to low priority) to see which valve(s) is in the wrong state
Depending on which valve(s) did not change, set current state to error level
Assert LEDs for error level (flashing, 3-5 seconds)
Switch LEDs to show which values are in error (higher priority first, 1 second each)
After this LED cycle, check each faulty valves to see if anything has been fixed (or just took too long to change)
Check if any valves are still in error
If so...
Reset error state
Loop back through error protocol for state and LEDs
        Else…
Set state back to all good
Assert LEDs
Go back to waiting for signal
